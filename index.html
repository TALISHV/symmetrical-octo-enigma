        <h3>MobileNet</h3>
        <p>MobileNet's first response was a ski mask however after a few attempts it said a remote control with an accuracy of 81.9%.</p>
        <h3>Google Lens</h3> 
        <p>Google Lens however displays more accurate results. It straight away identified the remote therefore fore better UI we should use Google Lens</p>
